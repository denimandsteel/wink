## About
We got tired of asking people to send us their browser information, screen size, and plugins... so we made it easier for everybody. Wink grabs a snapshot of the current browser and sends it away.

Please fork and make it better!

## Install
Hide somewhere discreet in your web root, send away.

## Todo

- Input validation so we don't take down servers
- Flash detection
